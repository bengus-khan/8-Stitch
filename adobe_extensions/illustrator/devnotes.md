## PixelStitch: Scripts for Adobe Illustrator

### Vector mask generator
- Script initialization dialog is fully functional. Tweak parameter ranges as needed.
- Script is not currently using the multi-anchor point path generation function. Need to fix this.
- Paths generated inside each row sublayer do not have unique names. Need to fix this.
